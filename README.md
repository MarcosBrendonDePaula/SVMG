# SVMM - Stardew Valley Modpack Manager

## 🌟 About

**SVMM (Stardew Valley Modpack Manager)** was born out of the need for Stardew Valley players to manage, synchronize, and update their mods easily and conveniently. Especially when playing with friends, mod synchronization can be tedious. This project aims to solve this problem by providing a single platform to manage all your mods, sync with your friends, and even automatically update your mods in future versions.

## 💡 Features

- **Modpack Menu**: Easily switch between different sets of mods.
- **Mod Synchronization**: Share and sync your mods with your friends in a few clicks.
- **Enable/Disable Mods**: Have the freedom to enable or disable mods as needed.


## 🚀 Motivation

Playing Stardew Valley with mods can be an amazing experience, but managing these mods can be a headache. Updating, installing, and syncing mods with friends is a time-consuming process. We want to improve the player experience by making the entire process easier and more efficient.

## 🤝 Collaboration

We are always open to collaborations. If you are a developer and love Stardew Valley as much as we do, feel free to fork, open issues, or submit pull requests.
